            MAYA Organization in 2009 by Tomilyn Ward. From 2009 to 2014, MAYA operated as a volunteer-run adoption and 
            birth mother advocacy agency, with a focus on fundraising and volunteer recruitment. In these years, MAYA provided pro bono 
            counseling for birthmothers, and was able to extend financial support to several families adopting children with special needs.
            In August of 2014, MAYA Organization grew into a staffed agency focusing on two initiatives: supporting people during pregnancy and beyond. Tomilyn continued to run MAYA Organization until June 2020, when she decided it was best to focus on providing counseling services. MAYA Organization continues to serve the needs of pregnant and parenting people in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

                Pam Keating is a counseling student in the Carlow University Professional Counseling Program.  Her focus throughout her education has been in providing trauma-informed care.  As a survivor, she wishes to work with clients to provide them with counseling services that will allow others to move from seeing themselves as victims of their past to survivors in the present.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pam recognizes life is hard, and for those who have experienced trauma, the hardships endured can be debilitating.  These hardships can be processed and resolved through a therapeutic alliance with a skilled counselor. With focus on providing tools for affect regulation and narrative processing, clients will learn the skills necessary to move through their emotions in a safe environment and apply them in their natural environment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pam seeks to help adolescents, young adults and adults who want to begin the process of healing. The sessions include compassion, support, and skill building in addressing issues related to both past and present-day hardships endured.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pam is skilled in working with trauma and trauma responses associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), relationship issues (interpersonal communicating), family issues (strategic family resolution), and communicating through feelings identification and expression (cognitive and dialectical).
